I'd rather be first than perfect

To make a move, you need to know what your opponent would do if you rolled :/.
However, to make a move from the same board state,
your opponent needs to know what you would do from that board state.

To plan a move, for each choice, assume that your opponent saw you move and get :/
and now assumes you would try to make the same move again and again until you didn't :/.
You can now determine their optimal strategy under that assumption,
and find out which original move gives them the worst optimal strategy.
